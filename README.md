# Keep Us Alive!
---
### Overview
---
Keep your survivor's alive, especially your Leader! as you hunt for the key to escape each level. A survivor cannot survive an attack from the Zombies and other monsters for long. Your goal is to move your survivors around the board to look for the activation pads which will give you a key once activated. A survivor can only hold one key at a time so you will need to use all your survivors to collect the keys. If a survivor dies, if they have a key, it will drop where the survivor died at but you will lose points. Lose all your survivors and it is Gameover! Can they survive with your guidance?


### Goal
Get all the survivors to the goal area usually blocked by some obstacles. Your survivors cannot attack so you will need to keep them moving to avoid being attacked. Once all the keys in a level are obtained you can access the door blocking the exit.
